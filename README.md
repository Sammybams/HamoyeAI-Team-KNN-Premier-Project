## Introduction
Sleep is one of the most fundamental components of everyday life. While the list of its benefits has not been exhaustively researched, it is known that sleep is required for effective rest and repair, consolidation of memory, easing of stress, improved mood, weight control, among many others. It is vital for alertness for the following day, or even the same day. It is recommended that an adult gets 6-8 hours of sleep daily.

However, the quality of sleep each individual gets is affected by a range of factors, both internal (such as sickness) or external (such as food, stress levels, social behaviour like smoking and alcohol drinking).

## Aims and Objectives
This project’s major aim is to determine the factors affecting an individual’s sleep efficiency, using machine learning methods and exploratory data analysis. In other words, Team KNN wanted to use this project to describe the trends in sleep efficiency using available data, and to predict future subjects’ sleep efficiency using data modelling and machine learning. Insights could also be applied to real-life subjects.

## Project Flow
To achieve the set aims and objectives for this project, we followed these listed steps:
- Data Sourcing & Description of Features
- Data Preparation/Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Modelling & Evaluation

<a id='conclusion'></a>
## Conclusion
In summary, using the modelled data and exploratory data analysis, we concluded that the factors responsible for good/poor sleep efficiency are:
1.	Awakenings
2.	Age
3.	Alcohol consumption
4.	Smoking status
5.	Sleep duration

## Recommendations
Age is not a factor that can be controlled. However, for the controllable ones:
- One should reduce the number of times they wake up at night. This could be done by urination before going to bed, use of earplugs, ensuring proper silence and darkness and removal of nearby electronic devices.
- Alcohol intake should be gradually reduced or stopped completely if possible.
- Individuals should avoid smoking.
- One should make the effort to sleep more at night. This could be done by increasing one’s exercise frequency and overall activity.
